# DSCI-441
Git repo for final project in DSCI-441 on mammalian dietary traits

The dimensionality of datasets processed and derived from studies, research projects and field analysis have vastly increased. This results in researchers needing to know skills that, in decades prior, would be considered non-essential. In research that leverages large and/or high-dimension datasets, an essential technique that is required today is the ability to conduct dimensionality reduction. Dimensions, or features, are the predictors that determine a model's output. At a glance, having more predictors than needed appears a non-issue, however it has ramifications: increased computation time, increased storage space requirements for big data, and other issues that can be constrained by a lab's financial backing. However, the biggest concern is that machine learning models trained on high-dimensional datasets often generalize poorly. In the evolutionary research domain of biological sciences, it is very common for research papers' final dataset(s) to feature non-standard formatting & nomenclature, inconsistent data structure, feature overlap, and other characteristics that interfere with the datasets ability to be used in further analysis. This project will apply dimensionality reduction techniques on datasets merged from various research papers to distill relevant features and improve robustness of data for further analysis.
